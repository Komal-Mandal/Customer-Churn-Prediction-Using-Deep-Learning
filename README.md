# 💻 Key Code Walkthrough

1. Importing Libraries

These libraries provide the tools to build, train, and evaluate our deep learning model.

1.tensorflow: The main library for deep learning, with tools for creating and training neural networks.

2.Sequential: A simple way to build models layer by layer.

3.Dense: Adds fully connected layers to the model.

4.Dropout: Prevents overfitting by randomly turning off some neurons during training.

5.pandas: Helps load and manipulate datasets easily.

6.numpy: Useful for mathematical operations and handling arrays.

7.matplotlib.pyplot: Creates graphs to visualize data and model performance.


2. Data Preprocessing

Before training a model, we need to clean and prepare the data to make it suitable for learning.

1.StandardScaler: A tool that adjusts all features (columns) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps the model learn more efficiently.

2.scaler.fit_transform(X_train): Calculates the scaling parameters (mean and standard deviation) using the training data and scales it accordingly.

3.scaler.transform(X_test): Uses the same scaling parameters to scale the test data. This ensures consistency between training and testing.

Think of this step as converting all your data points to a uniform scale, so no feature dominates others due to larger numbers.


3. Building the Neural Network

We use the Sequential API to stack layers one by one to build our neural network.

1.ense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]):

1.1 Adds a layer with 64 neurons.

1.2 activation='relu': The ReLU function (Rectified Linear Unit) ensures only positive values pass through. It helps the model learn complex patterns.

1.3 input_dim=X_train.shape[1]: Sets the input size equal to the number of features in the dataset.

2.Dropout(0.5):

2.1 Randomly turns off 50% of neurons during training. This prevents the model from relying too much on specific neurons, reducing overfitting.

3.Dense(32, activation='relu'):

3.1 Adds another layer with 32 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function again for better learning.

4.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'):

4.1 The final layer has 1 neuron because this is a binary classification problem (e.g., "Yes" or "No").

4.2 activation='sigmoid': Squashes the output to a range between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.

4. Compiling the Model

This step sets up the learning process for the model.

1.optimizer='adam': Adam is an efficient algorithm for updating weights during training. It adjusts the learning rate automatically.

2.loss='binary_crossentropy': This loss function measures the error for binary classification problems. It tells the model how far off its predictions are from the true answers.

3.metrics=['accuracy']: Tracks accuracy during training and evaluation, so we know how well the model is doing.

5. Training the Model

This is where the model learns by adjusting weights based on the data.

1.X_train_scaled, y_train: The training data (features and labels) is fed into the model.

2.validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test): The model uses test data to validate its performance after each epoch.

3.epochs=50: The model sees the entire training data 50 times to learn patterns.

4.batch_size=32: The data is divided into smaller groups (batches) of 32 samples each for efficient processing.

6. Visualizing Training Performance

This step helps us understand how well the model performed over time.

1.history.history['accuracy']: Tracks the accuracy of the model on training data over each epoch.

2.history.history['val_accuracy']: Tracks accuracy on validation data over each epoch.

3.plt.plot(): Draws the graph for training and validation accuracy.

4.plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(): Labels the x-axis (Epochs) and y-axis (Accuracy).

5.plt.legend(): Adds a legend to distinguish between training and validation accuracy lines.

6.plt.show(): Displays the graph.
